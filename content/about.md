# About

I'm a software engineer delivering complex enterprise applications for large organisations.

In my spare time I love trying out new languages and tools. Take a look at my [GitHub](https://github.com/ChrisWilding) profile; it contains a mixture of coding exercises, previous technical tests and some small applications I have used to learn and experiment with a new framework, language or technology.
